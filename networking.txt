>> Local host (127.0.0.1)
>> What is localhost and where can I access it?

Localhost is the url on a computer that points to itself. The computer does not need the internet for the address to work since it only checks on itself.
To access localhost, you write localhost or 127.0.0.1 on the browser.
When you try to access localhost now, you will find nothing there. 
or see default apache page(if apache is installed).
You need to host a html file on a server(on your computer) that serves a page on localhost.
