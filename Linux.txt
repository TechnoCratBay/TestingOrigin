n ‘/usr’ go all the executable files, libraries, source of most of the system programs. 
For this reason, most of the files contained therein is read­only (for the normal user)

‘/usr/bin’ contains basic user commands
‘/usr/sbin’ contains additional commands for the administrator
‘/usr/lib’ contains the system libraries
‘/usr/share’ contains documentation or common to all libraries, for example ‘/usr/share/man’ contains the text of the manpage
